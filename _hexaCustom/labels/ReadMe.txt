Here you can find xml files named by collection theme name. These files can overwrite labels in theme to add custom name.

For example, "gta" collection display "Grand Theft Auto" in theme because it's define in gta.xml file.

Concrete idea, you can add auto-favorites.xml and use this file to display "Mickael's favorites".
